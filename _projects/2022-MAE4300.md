## Ethical Analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX Crisis

In my analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX crashes, it became clear that the failure was not caused by a single engineering mistake, but by a chain of interconnected technical, organizational, economic, and regulatory decisions. The crisis demonstrates how modern engineering systems are complex and tightly intertwined, meaning that decisions made in one domain can have unintended consequences across many others.

The technical decision that set this chain of events in motion was Boeing’s choice to install larger, more fuel-efficient LEAP-1B engines on the existing 737 airframe. While this helped improve fuel efficiency and stay competitive in the market, it also changed the aircraft’s aerodynamics, center of gravity, and pitch behavior. To manage these changes, Boeing introduced the MCAS software system. However, MCAS relied on input from a single angle-of-attack sensor and could repeatedly command nose-down trim without sufficient redundancy or clear pilot awareness. From an engineering perspective, this introduced a dangerous single point of failure in a safety-critical system.

Organizational and economic pressures heavily influenced these design decisions. Boeing was under intense pressure to compete with Airbus and bring the 737 MAX to market quickly. To avoid expensive pilot retraining and certification delays, the aircraft was presented as a minor update rather than a fundamentally new design. This approach shaped both internal engineering choices and the certification process, encouraging engineers to stay on schedule, limit design changes, and treat MCAS as a small software addition instead of a system requiring deeper scrutiny.

The regulatory structure further amplified these problems. Through the Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program, the FAA delegated much of the certification responsibility to Boeing itself. While this delegation is intended to improve efficiency, it blurred accountability and reduced independent oversight. As a result, engineers could reasonably believe that meeting delegated certification requirements was enough, even when broader safety risks remained. This lack of regulatory clarity weakened the system’s ability to identify and address critical issues before the aircraft entered service.

At the individual level, engineers faced real constraints that limited ethical action. Hierarchical pressure, job security concerns, incomplete visibility into the full system, and a corporate culture focused on efficiency made it difficult to escalate concerns. Even when risks were recognized, engineers often lacked the authority or protection needed to challenge decisions that prioritized schedule and cost over safety.

Looking at this case through the ASME Code of Ethics makes it clear where ethical priorities broke down. Canon 1, which requires engineers to put public safety first, should have outweighed concerns about loyalty to the company, project timelines, or profitability. Instead, it repeatedly conflicted with Canon 4 (serving employers) and Canon 7 (controlled communication), without a clear ethical hierarchy to guide decisions. As a result, public safety was not consistently treated as the top priority.

Ultimately, this case shows that ethical engineering can’t depend on individual integrity alone. Avoiding similar failures requires changes at multiple levels: better ethics training and support for engineers, organizational structures that encourage speaking up about safety issues, and broader reforms such as independent oversight, clearer certification standards, and stronger whistleblower protections. The Boeing 737 MAX crisis highlights how, when systems make ethical action difficult, even well-intentioned engineers can end up contributing to serious failures. Aligning technical work, company culture, and regulatory oversight is critical to protecting public safety.
