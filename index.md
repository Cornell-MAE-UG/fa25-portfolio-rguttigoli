## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/new headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .profile-image}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a strong interest in hands-on design, analysis, and systems engineering. My experience spans electromechanical design, robotics, and energy systems, including designing custom electromagnets and levitation concepts on Cornell Hyperloop, optimizing wind-turbine blades using BEM theory and structural stress analysis, and building autonomous competition robots under tight size and power constraints. I am drawn to projects that sit at the intersection of hardware and real-world impact - whether that means developing assistive devices to improve accessibility, analyzing thermal performance in industrial systems, or translating theoretical models into manufacturable designs. Through coursework, team projects, and professional experiences, I have developed a strong foundation in CAD, MATLAB, experimental testing, and iterative design, and I am motivated by opportunities to apply engineering principles to create practical, well-thought-out solutions.
